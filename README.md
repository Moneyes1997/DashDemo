Hello there, it is a small dash demo with dummy revenue data. Havn't got time to polish it yet.

Basically, what it can do is to predict next 3 months' revenue whenever a movie is selected.

Below is a demo deployed on Heroku:

Please bear in mind as it is a free dyno, the above demo can take several seconds to react. However, on my personal laptop it takes just a fraction of a second.
